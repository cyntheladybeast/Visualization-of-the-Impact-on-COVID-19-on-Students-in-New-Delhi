The distribution of students by level of schooling reaffirmed the dominance of college students, aligning with the age distribution findings. 
Senior high school students were found to spend more time on online classes, prompting considerations about their academic engagement and time management strategies compared to other schooling levels.

Despite variations in time allocation for activities like sleep, fitness, and social media, consistent patterns across different schooling levels suggest adaptability and continuity in students' daily routines amidst pandemic disruptions. 
The reported absence of significant health issues among surveyed students, due to online learning's preventive measures, underscores the potential benefits of digital education in maintaining student well-being during crises.

Social media platform preferences varied by age group, with Instagram being popular among college students and YouTube among junior and senior high school students. 
This diversity reflects age-related content consumption and interaction preferences, highlighting the need for tailored digital engagement strategies.

Device preferences for online learning showed a preference for laptops among college students and smartphones among younger students, emphasizing the importance of technological equity and optimizing digital learning environments.
The comparative analysis between pre and post-COVID data offers a profound understanding of the transformative impact of the pandemic on various aspects of students' lives and educational experiences. 
The data reveals the significant increase in time spent on online classes across all schooling levels post-pandemic, the adoption of smartphones and laptops for online education, reflecting the changing dynamics of technological integration in education and positive trends observed in students' mental and physical well-being post-pandemic.
